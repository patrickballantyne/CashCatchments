# CashCatchments

Code used to delineate catchments for cash points in the UK.

## Overview

HERE API is used to delineate 10-minute walking isolines for cash points and post offices across the UK, to enable insights about the characteristics of cash catchments to be generated.

A couple of extra considerations are needed:

- We have upgraded the HERE API account from Freemium, to ensure the API doesn't hit limits.
- We have also utilised the GDSL Linux machines to parallelise these operations; would be too slow without them. 

Code is available [HERE](https://github.com/patrickballantyne/CashCatchments/blob/main/Code/Code.R).
